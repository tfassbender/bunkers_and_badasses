Bunkers and Badasses - Tasks


- Current Bugs:
	- make recruiting heros a turn
	- start resources seem to be added to much or to often
	- can't go on in PreGameSelection when the base is chosen before the second player confirms his skill
	- turn bonus images are not always shown in the selection screen (images not loaded?; the one that a player puts back)
	- a player can't pass when it's the first move and he has no commands (or nothing executed)
	- debug fights:
		- sometimes a player can't choose his fallen troops and the battle doesn't end
		- surviving troops in normal fights are calculated wrong
		- fight end text fields need to be cleared (fight execution frame)
		- some fallen troops are selected in fields that didn't even take part in the fight (only possible retreat)
		- sometimes the support requests are not shown (defender)
		- when a fight isn't executed till end another execution can be started (any command)
		- when attacking with only crimson raiders also bandits can fall (if there are any in the attacking field)
		- sometimes the fight execution frame doesn't appear
			
- Next versions:
	- fix the stream corrupted exception
	- slider for zoom on board
	- implement the storing of the used resources
	- implement hero functions
	- implement storing and loading of the game in the database
	- create the statistics of a game and store them in the database when the game ends
	- marker position bug in Rakk's Hive
	- open new dialogs centered to the game frame ?
	- support image in help menu is shown very small
	- somehow board images are sent (overwritten to no image send; check why images were sent)
	- implement the back to main menu button in the fight end frame 

- New ideas:
	- New neutral troops like Threshers (maybe moving each turn)
	- dragging the board with the mouse
