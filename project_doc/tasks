Bunkers and Badasses - Tasks


- Current Bugs:
	- only one winner when there two have the same points
	- both players want to add the final game and the statistics (causes sql error)
	- fight system bug: all supporting troops can fall (attack supporters)
	- fights against neutral troops seem to be buggy (falling troops)
	- sometimes two or more pre-game dialogs start
	- used resources are sometimes calculated wrong (?)
	- support request answers are not all received if they are clicked to fast... (?)

- Next versions:
	- some games can't be loaded for unknown reasons (exception says server timeout when saving; logs say game is loaded two times)
	- add a summary of a move in a confirm dialog before executing a move (and the option to turn the confirm dialog off)
	- database server keep alive
	- add listing of gained resources (and lost standard resources for fields, ...) to the resource frame
	- implement hero functions
	- create the statistics of a game and store them in the database when the game ends

- New ideas:
	- maybe soundtrack
	- update help dialog
