Bunkers and Badasses - Tasks


- Current Bugs:
	- open new dialogs centered to the game frame ?
	- support image in help menu is shown very small
	- somehow board images are sent (overwritten to no image send; check why images were sent)
	- game request can't be sent when an error in the dialog once occurred
	- the start user is not set in the game
	- hero images are not loaded after sending
	- the board image is not updated in all dialogs (e.g. TurnExecution)
	- make recruiting heros a turn
	- fix graphic problems in select hero card frame (not loaded after sending?)
	- sometimes when raiding the target can't be chosen
	- raids don't remove the command
	
- Next versions:
	- all frames are named "Bunkers and Badasses - ...", makes it hard to differentiate in the task line
	- fix the stream corrupted exception
	- slider for zoom on board
	- implement the storing of the used resources
	- implement hero and building functions
	- implement storing and loading of the game in the database
	- create the statistics of a game and store them in the database when the game ends
