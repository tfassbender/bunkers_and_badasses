Bunkers and Badasses - Tasks


- Current Bugs:
	- some turn goals seem to be not added to the points (capitalism)
	- used resources are sometimes calculated wrong (?)
	- debug fights:
		- fight end text fields need to be cleared (fight execution frame)
		- some fallen troops are selected in fields that didn't even take part in the fight (only possible retreat) (?)
		- heros seem to be not removed from the players hand sometimes (?)
		
- Next versions:
	- fix the stream corrupted exception (almost)
	- implement hero functions
	- implement storing and loading of the game in the database
	- create the statistics of a game and store them in the database when the game ends
	- somehow board images are sent (overwritten to no image send; check why images were sent)
	- implement the back to main menu button in the fight end frame 

- New ideas:
	- New neutral troops like Threshers (maybe moving each turn)
	- different skins for players troops (hyperion bots, guardians, ...)
	- new falling troops calculation:
		- falling troops can be chosen by the winner
		- troops fall on both sides
		- maximum is all troops on the side with less troops
		- minimum is half troops on the side with less troops
		- should result in more falling troops
