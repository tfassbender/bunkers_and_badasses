Bunkers and Badasses - Tasks


- Current Bugs:
	- eridium seems to be not (always) added in the new turn (test implementation)
	- sometimes two or more pre-game dialogs start
	- some turn goals seem to be not added to the points (capitalism) (test implementation)
	- used resources are sometimes calculated wrong (?)
	- debug fights:
		- fight end text fields need to be cleared (fight execution frame)
		- some fallen troops are selected in fields that didn't even take part in the fight (only possible retreat) (?)
		- heros seem to be not removed from the players hand sometimes (?)
		
- Next versions:
	- add icon to compiled version
	- some changes in turn execution gui (smaller view)
	- add some functions to the gui (e.g. opening turn goal dialog via double clicking)
	- implement hero functions
	- implement storing and loading of the game in the database
	- create the statistics of a game and store them in the database when the game ends
	- somehow board images are sent (overwritten to no image send; check why images were sent)
	- implement the back to main menu button in the game end frame 

- New ideas:
	- New neutral troops like Threshers (maybe moving each turn)
