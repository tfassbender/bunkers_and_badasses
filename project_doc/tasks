Bunkers and Badasses - Tasks


- Current Bugs:
	- hero images are not updated after the heros are used
	- sometimes two or more pre-game dialogs start
	- some turn goals seem to be not added to the points (capitalism) (test implementation)
	- used resources are sometimes calculated wrong (?)
	- debug fights:
		- heros seem to be not removed from the players hand sometimes (?)
		
- Next versions:
	- implement default selection of fields for tavern recruiting (select catch-a-ride fields first)
	- add a summary of a move in a confirm dialog before executing a move (and the option to turn the confirm dialog off)
	- database server keep alive
	- add listing of gained resources (and lost standard resources for fields, ...) to the resource frame
	- inform players when one player leaves the game (for any reason)
	- implement hero functions
	- create the statistics of a game and store them in the database when the game ends
	- implement the back to main menu button in the game end frame 

- New ideas:
	- maybe soundtrack
	- update help dialog
