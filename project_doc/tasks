Bunkers and Badasses - Tasks


- Current Bugs:
	- open new dialogs centered to the game frame ?
	- support image in help menu is shown very small
	- somehow board images are sent (overwritten to no image send; check why images were sent)
	- the board image is not updated in all dialogs (e.g. TurnExecution)
	- make recruiting heros a turn
	- start resources seem to be added to much or to often
	- can't go on in PreGameSelection when the base is chosen before the second player confirms his skill
	- additional commands from turn bonus cards don't seem to work
	- given commands are not reseted after the turn ends (game state is not set to plan when the turn starts)
	- users can select the same bonus after passing (even the bonus an other player holds)
	- additional commands that are bought can't be payed (?)
	- the commands a player has are not resetet at the turn beginning
	- debug fights:
		- skag fights: support ends when one player sends the support answer
		- sometimes a player can't choose his fallen troops and the battle doesn't end
		- surviving troops in normal fights are calculated wrong
			
- Next versions:
	- fix the stream corrupted exception
	- slider for zoom on board
	- implement the storing of the used resources
	- implement hero and building functions
	- implement storing and loading of the game in the database
	- create the statistics of a game and store them in the database when the game ends
	- marker position bug in Rakk's Hive

- New ideas:
	- New neutral troops like Threshers (maybe moving each turn)
	- dragging the board with the mouse
