Bunkers and Badasses - Tasks


- Current Bugs:
	- character encoding
	- open new dialogs centered to the game frame ?
	- show all heroes (in game) button in HeroSelectionDialog has no effect
	- commands can't be added (nullpointer)
	
- Next versions:
	- all frames are named "Bunkers and Badasses - ...", makes it hard to differentiate in the task line
	- fix the stream corrupted exception
	- slider for zoom on board
	- help dialogs need to be implemented
	- implement the storing of the used resources
	- implement hero and building functions
	- implement storing and loading of the game in the database
	- create the statistics of a game and store them in the database when the game ends
