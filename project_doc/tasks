Bunkers and Badasses - Tasks


- Current Bugs:
	- sometimes two or more pre-game dialogs start
	- used resources are sometimes calculated wrong (?)
	- implement the hero functions of Angel and Arschgaul
	- heros should be only usable in the players turn
	- the game reference in all heros seems to be wrong (has no board, game-frame or turn manager)
	- some heros seem to have a old reference to the game (no board or game frame; seems to be non-starting players)

- Next versions:
	- some games can't be loaded for unknown reasons (exception says server timeout when saving; logs say game is loaded two times)
	- add a summary of a move in a confirm dialog before executing a move (and the option to turn the confirm dialog off)
	- after long games the server seems to not be able to hold the game communication...
	- add listing of gained resources (and lost standard resources for fields, ...) to the resource frame
	- implement hero functions

- New ideas:
	- maybe soundtrack
	- update help dialog
